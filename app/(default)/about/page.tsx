              We never planned to start a property management company. All we
              wanted was a simple update about a small piece of land our family
              owned in India. Living abroad, we leaned on relatives for answers,
              but updates were vague, delayed, or missing altogether. “Looks
              like someone built a shed there,” an uncle once said. Weeks of
              silence followed.

              Frustration turned into worry. Were the boundaries intact? Was the
              land being misused? Zooming into blurry satellite maps wasn’t
              enough. That’s when it hit us, if we were struggling, thousands of
              <b>absentee owners</b> must be too. SpotMySite was born, not from
              a business plan, but from the need for{" "}
              <b>clarity, connection, and trust</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built a team of people on the ground who could{" "}
              <b>see it, record it, and report it, exactly as it is</b>. No
              sugarcoating. No sales pitches. Just clear proof. Over time, we
              expanded land inspections, cleanups, fencing, remote buyer
              walkthroughs, legal help, and NRI loan support.

              We’re not brokers. We don’t sell property or take commissions. We
              work only for you, as if it were our own land. Every video,
              report, or visit we deliver answers one question: “If this were
              mine, what would I want to know right now?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, SpotMySite is a growing team of{" "}
              <b>field agents, legal experts, and remote support</b> across
              Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, giving <b>absentee owners</b> the
              <b>proof, perspective, and peace of mind</b> they’ve always
              needed.

              If you’ve ever worried about your property back home, you’re not
              alone. We’ve been there. That’s why we built SpotMySite,{" "}
              <b>for people like us, for people like you</b>.
